    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Working as a Junior DevOps Consultant for Holcim EMEA Digital Center,
      the EMEA IT services company of the Holcim Group, a top Swiss
      multinational company that manufactures building materials.

      I love computers and technology in general since I was a kid.
      
      I am a very curious person, and I am constantly looking forward to learn
      anything I can. I love to discover new things, to explore alternatives,
      and to think about different ways to get the same result.
      
      Since I discovered the DevOps world when I started working as a trainee,
      I realized that it is like the application of what interests me most of
      computers to real world IT companies, so this is where I'd love to
      continue developing my career in.

education:
    - degree: Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering
      university: Universidad Complutense de Madrid
      time: 2017 - 2022
      details: |
        Courses passed with honors:
          - Fundamentals of Programming (12 ECTS).
          - Data structures and algorithms (9 ECTS).

experiences:
    - role: Automation DevOps Trainee
      time: oct 2021 - jun 2022
      company: Holcim EMEA Digital Center
      details: |
        Position in a DevOps team.

        As a trainee, at the start I recieved formation in a few technologies:
          - Preparation course for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.
          - Preparation course for AWS Solutions Architect – Associate
            certification.
          - OpenShift fundamentals.
          - Terraform and Terragrunt fundamentals.
        
        Then, I started performing tasks:
          - AWS resource management using the AWS console, the AWS CLI v2 and
            IaC tools (Terraform and Terragrunt).
            - IAM: creation and management of users, roles and policies.
            - S3: creation and management of buckets, including lifecycle
              configurations and versioning.
            - RDS: backup management, restoring from snapshot, parameter groups.
            - VPC, EC2, CloudWatch, Route 53...
          - Design and maintenance of GitOps-based platforms.
            - For deploying and managing cloud infrastructure.
              - Git repositories stored in GitHub defining AWS and ElasticCloud
              resources.
              - Triggering of GitHub Actions workflows to run Terragrunt and
              keep the real infrastructure in sync with what is defined in the
              Git repositories (Git as source of truth).
              - Creation of custom Terraform modules.
            - For defining web services configuration.
              - Git repositories stored in GitHub with configuration files.
              - Triggering of GitHub Actions workflows to make API requests
              using curl.
        
        Apart from those main tasks, which may define my current main knowledge,
        I am also learning about the DevOps environment:
          - Application deployment in container orchestration platforms
            (OpenShift) using CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins).
          - Process automation (Ansible Tower).
          - Observability (ELK stack).
