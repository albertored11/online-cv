      Computer Science student at
      [Facultad de Informática](https://informatica.ucm.es/),

      I am currently on my last year. Also working as a trainee in a DevOps
      position.

      I love computers and technology in general since I was a kid.
      
      I am a very curious person, and I am constantly looking forward to learn
      anything I can. I love to discover new things, to explore alternatives,
      and to think about different ways to get the same result.

        Position in a DevOps team.

        As a trainee, at the start I recieved formation in a few technologies:
          - Preparation course for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.
          - Preparation course for AWS Solutions Architect – Associate
            certification.
          - OpenShift fundamentals.
          - Terraform and Terragrunt fundamentals.
        
        Then, I started performing tasks:
          - AWS resource management using the AWS console, the AWS CLI v2 and
            IaC tools (Terraform and Terragrunt).
            - IAM: creation and management of users, roles and policies.
            - S3: creation and management of buckets, including lifecycle
              configurations and versioning.
            - RDS: backup management, restoring from snapshot, parameter groups.
            - VPC, EC2, CloudWatch, Route 53...
          - Design and maintenance of GitOps-based platforms.
            - For deploying and managing cloud infrastructure.
              - Git repositories stored in GitHub defining AWS and ElasticCloud
              resources.
              - Triggering of GitHub Actions workflows to run Terragrunt and
              keep the real infrastructure in sync with what is defined in the
              Git repositories (Git as source of truth).
              - Creation of custom Terraform modules.
            - For defining web services configuration.
              - Git repositories stored in GitHub with configuration files.
              - Triggering of GitHub Actions workflows to make API requests
              using curl.
        
        Apart from those main tasks, which may define my current main knowledge,
        I am also learning about the DevOps environment:
          - Application deployment in container orchestration platforms
            (OpenShift) using CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins).
          - Process automation (Ansible Tower).
          - Observability (ELK stack).
